PyChap
======

Advanced challenge response authentication for Python
-----------------------------------------------------

Although there is a specification for [digest access
authentication][digest-rfc], PyChap is being designed to implement a more robust
challenge response protocol described by [Paul Johnston] in what he calls the
[alternative system].

The functionality of PyChap is just some very simple logic code, but sometimes
seeing an implementation of a difficult to understand idea can help get a better
understanding of it.
